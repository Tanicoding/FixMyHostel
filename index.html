    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In most college hostels, students face daily issues like electrical faults, plumbing leaks,
      poor WiFi connectivity, unclean facilities, or delayed maintenance. The absence of a transparent,
      trackable, and centralized complaint management system leads to miscommunication, unresolved issues,
      and frustration among students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problems are often reported manually through paper forms, phone calls, or verbal communication —
      methods that are inefficient, unorganized, and prone to delays. Administrators also lack a data-driven
      way to monitor maintenance trends, staff performance, or recurring issues.

    <p>
      Students can register complaints, upload details or photos, and track real-time status — all in one place.

      resolution with automated reminders and analytics. This fosters accountability, transparency, and a smoother
      hostel experience for everyone.
